# Human Rights and Policy Considerations Research Group

The Human Rights and Policy Considerations (HRPC) research group is chartered
to research the relationship between Internet protocols and standards to
human rights and public interest policy (as a cross section of public policy
focused on human rights). The group specifically aims to research protocol
developments that can impact or are mindful of human rights, and to explore
whether standards and protocols can enable, strengthen or threaten human rights,
as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) [1] and
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) [2].

## Background

The research group takes as its starting point the statement that
human-rights-enabling characteristics of the Internet might be degraded if
they are not properly defined, described, and sufficiently taken into
account in protocol and standards development. Not protecting these
characteristics could result in (partial) loss of functionality and
connectivity.

The Internet aims to be the global network of networks that provides
unfettered connectivity to all users at all times and for any content.
Open, secure, and reliable connectivity is essential for rights such as
freedom of expression and freedom of association. Since the Internetâ€™s
objective of connectivity intersects with human rights, its architectural
design considerations overlap with the human rights framework.

Moreover, it is widely accepted that technical design decisions about the
Internet are not value neutral and can have impacts on public
interest policy and individual human rights. 
Further, the development and deployment of Internet protocols
can influence public interest policy concerns
that intersect with human rights. The Global Data Protection
Regulation [3], the principles of necessity and proportionality of
surveillance [4] are examples of policy developments that influenced the discussion
in the IETF and IRTF, through the Privacy Enhancements and Assessments
Research Group (PEARG). An increase in similar regulatory actions can currently
be observed are expected grow as the digital age progresses.

## Research question

Our main research question is: "How are human rights and public interest
policy considered during the development of Internet standards?"

We seek to ask (in no specific order):

- What are established models for evaluating these considerations and how
  do they potentially apply to Internet standards development?

- Which human rights are strengthened and which are weakened by a given
  protocol's design decision?

- Can protocol's design decisions benefit from an established model that
  evaluates human rights and public interest policy considerations?

- How does the development and deployment of Internet protocols
  influence public interest policy concerns that intersect with human rights, and vice versa?

HRPC has intersections with other research groups: with Privacy Enhancements
and Assessments Research Group (PEARG) on privacy as a human right, with
Global Access to the Internet for All (GAIA), and with Research and Analysis of
Standard-Setting Processes Research Group (RASPRG) on analysing how the standards
process is impacted by value judgements.

## Objectives

 * To expose the relations between protocols and human rights values, with
   a focus on the human rights framework, such as the policy implications
   of technology choices and the technical implications of policy choices.

 * To suggest guidelines to protect the Internet as a human-rights-enabling
   environment and a global public good in future protocol development.

 * To increase awareness in both the human rights research community and the
   technical community of the importance of the Internet's technical
   workings, and their impact on human rights and the public interest.

 * To create a place for discussions and analysis of the relationship
   between protocol development, and their human rights and public interest policy
   implications by, among other mechanisms, serving as a bridge between
   the human rights researcher and the protocol's development communities.

 * To support the protocol development process in recognizing potential
   public interest policy impacts, as well as help to develop recommendations
   to address those impacts adequately. 

## Outputs

The research group may work on Internet-Drafts, some of which may be published in IRTF RFC stream,
or research papers, for publication elsewhere, covering the topics as outlined in the objectives above.

## Membership

Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain current
with the published documents and mailing list issues.
